# Renvestment Solution Architecture

### 1. System Overview & Non-Functional Requirements

**System Overview:**
Renvestment is a FinTech platform designed to solve financial friction between Canadian landlords and tenants. It facilitates on-time rent payments by offering tenants cashback rewards, which can be automatically invested. The platform aims to reduce late payments and tenant turnover for landlords while helping tenants turn their biggest expense into a tool for long-term financial growth .

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**
Based on the provided documentation, the following NFRs are critical for the MVP and future scaling:

* **Performance:**
    * The system must maintain a response time of **<500ms** for all critical user interactions.
    * The architecture must be scalable to support an initial target of **1,000 concurrent users** and grow to 10,000+ active users by Year 2.

* **Security:**
    * **Authentication:** All user roles must be authenticated via email/password and phone verification (2FA).
    * **Authorization:** The system must implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access their designated data and functionality.
    * **Data Protection:** All sensitive data, especially tokenized bank details and personally identifiable information (PII), must be encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest.
    * **Identity Verification:** The platform must integrate a Know Your Customer (KYC) process for user verification to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

* **Compliance:**
    * The platform must be built to comply with **PCI DSS** standards for handling payment information (delegated primarily via Stripe).
    * It must adhere to Canada's **PIPEDA** regulations for data privacy.
    * The business must be prepared to register as a Money Services Business (**MSB**) before launch.

* **Reliability & Availability:**
    * The platform must achieve **99.9% uptime**.
    * Disaster recovery targets are a Recovery Point Objective (**RPO**) of **≤1 hour** and a Recovery Time Objective (**RTO**) of **≤4 hours**.

* **Usability:**
    * The user interface must follow a **mobile-first, responsive design** to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
    * The platform support multilingual capabilities, starting with **English and French** in the future phase.

### 2. Architectural Pattern & Core Tech Stack

**Architectural Pattern:** **Modular Monolith**
* **Justification:** For an MVP, this pattern provides the ideal balance between development speed and future scalability. It allows the core functionalities (users, contracts, payments) to be built and deployed as a single unit, reducing initial complexity. By designing the application in distinct, loosely-coupled modules, we can easily extract them into separate microservices as the platform scales.

**Recommended Tech Stack:**

* **Backend:**
    * **Language:** C#
    * **Framework:** ASP.NET Core
    * **Database:** PostgreSQL (Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
    * *Rationale:* This stack is robust, highly performant, and aligns perfectly with the CTO's extensive enterprise and Azure experience, ensuring strong leadership and faster development. PostgreSQL offers excellent transactional integrity, which is non-negotiable for a financial application.

* **Frontend:**
    * **Framework/Library:** Next.js (React)
    * **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand
    * *Rationale:* Next.js provides a powerful React framework with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out-of-the-box, improving performance and SEO for a better user acquisition funnel.

* **Deployment:**
    * **Cloud Provider:** Microsoft Azure
    * **Containerization:** Docker
    * **Strategy:** The backend application and database will be containerized using Docker and deployed to **Azure App Service** and **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**. A CI/CD pipeline will be set up using **GitHub Actions** or **Azure DevOps** for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
    * *Rationale:* Leveraging the CTO's deep expertise in the Azure ecosystem will de-risk the project and accelerate deployment. Azure provides a secure, compliant, and scalable environment that meets all stated NFRs.

### 3. Logical Component Breakdown & Interactions

**Component List:**

1.  **WebApp Frontend (Next.js):** The responsive web client that serves the UI to all user roles (Tenant, Landlord, PM, Admin).
2.  **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests, responsible for routing, authentication, and rate limiting. APIM in Azure or standalong .NET stack Ocelot (reverse proxy).
3.  **User Service (Module):** Manages user registration, login, profiles, roles, and KYC status.
4.  **Contract Service (Module):** Handles the creation, management, and digital signing of rental agreements.
5.  **Payment Service (Module):** Orchestrates all financial transactions. It integrates with **Stripe** for both collecting rent payments and distributing all payouts (to landlord, PM, and tenant cashback via direct deposit/EFT). This service contains the core fund distribution logic 62.
6.  **Notification Service (Module):** Manages and sends all user communications, such as payment reminders and confirmations, via email (e.g., SendGrid) and SMS (e.g., Twilio).
7.  **Primary Database (PostgreSQL):** The relational database storing all core application data.
8.  **External Services:** Third-party APIs, including **Stripe** (Payments, KYC, EFT Payouts) and notification providers.

**Interaction Diagram (Textual):**
> The **User** interacts with the **WebApp Frontend**. The **WebApp Frontend** sends all requests to the **API Gateway** over **REST/HTTPS**. The **API Gateway** authenticates the request and forwards it to the appropriate internal service module within the monolith (e.g., `User Service`, `Payment Service`). The **Payment Service** communicates directly with the **Stripe API** to process rent collection and orchestrate all payouts. The **Notification Service** is triggered by events from other services (e.g., a successful payment) to send emails or SMS messages. All service modules read from and write to the **Primary Database**.

### 5. Key Design Decisions & Rationale

* **Decision:** Adopt a **Modular Monolith** architecture for the MVP.
    * **Rationale:** This approach reduces initial deployment complexity, allowing the team to move faster and focus on core features, while preserving the option to scale into microservices later.
* **Decision:** Utilize a **C#/.NET backend**, **Next.js frontend**, and **PostgreSQL database**, all hosted on **Microsoft Azure**.
    * **Rationale:** This stack was chosen to directly leverage the CTO's deep expertise in the Microsoft and Azure ecosystem, minimizing technical risk and maximizing development efficiency. The specific frameworks were confirmed as the preferred choice.
* **Decision:** Centralize all payment and payout operations through **Stripe**.
    * **Rationale:** To solve the challenge of not having a direct Wealthsimple API, we will use Stripe's infrastructure for both rent collection and direct deposit (EFT) payouts for tenant cashback, landlord rent, and PM commissions. This strategy unifies the payment system within a single, compliant provider.
* **Decision:** Implement a manual, status-based workflow for dispute resolution.
    * **Rationale:** For the MVP, an admin can flag a transaction in the system as "Disputed," which pauses any associated actions. After an offline investigation (e.g., phone calls), the admin will manually update the transaction's final status to "Resolved" or "Failed," ensuring human oversight for complex issues without over-engineering an automated system at this early stage.


### 6. Proof of Concept (PoC) Development & Tech Stack
The PoC will focus on rapid, end-to-end validation of the core user and contract management flows. This initial phase intentionally uses a simplified, unified technology stack for agility before transitioning to the full C#/.NET architecture.

#### 6.1 PoC Goals
The following features must be operational and deployed on Vercel:

1. **Web Layout Look & Feel Confirmation**: Develop the primary landlord and tenant dashboards and forms to confirm the core UI/UX design.

2. **User Registration Flow Complete**: Implement email/password registration and profile setup (Landlord vs. Tenant roles).

3. **Contract Creation & Management**: A Landlord can create a lease contract, and a Tenant can view and "accept" the contract. Database schemas must support this relationship.

4. **Rent Payment Simulation**: The frontend can trigger a payment request that interacts with the backend and successfully processes the payment through the Mock External System.

#### 6.2 PoC Technology Stack
| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| Frontend/API/Deployment | Next.js (App Router) & Vercel | Enables rapid full-stack development and serverless API routes, optimized for quick deployment on the target platform (Vercel). |
| Database | Vercel PostgreSQL | Directly integrates with the Vercel platform, providing a managed, native relational database for the PoC data model. |
| Database ORM/Access | Prisma or Drizzle | Recommended ORM to manage schema migrations and provide type-safe database access within the Next.js environment. |
| Authentication | Auth.js (NextAuth.js) | Provides a robust, full-stack solution for handling user sessions, credentials, and role-based access control required by the registration flow. |

#### 6.3 Mock External System Recommendation (Mock Stripe API)
To simulate the rent payment process (Goal #4) without requiring a real Stripe account or a separate C# service, we will build the mock payment system using the following approach:

- Recommended Stack: Next.js API Routes (Route Handlers) within the PoC application.

- Implementation: Create endpoints such as /api/mock-payment/charge and /api/mock-payment/payout.

- Logic: These endpoints will contain simple, deterministic logic:

    - They accept the transaction amount and user IDs.

    - They simulate a successful Stripe payment_intent.succeeded response 90% of the time and a "failure" response 10% of the time, allowing the main application to test both success and error paths.

    - The mock endpoints will instantly update the local Vercel PostgreSQL database with a final status, simulating the effect of the Stripe webhook.

- Benefit: This co-located solution is the fastest to develop, deploy, and maintain, ensuring the PoC remains a single, coherent application.
